#Problem 5
#Credit to Udacity for base Block and LinkedList objects
#Block references previous block and previous hash so that it can check whether or not the data has been changed
#Time Complexity - Append is O(n) time - loops through linked list once
#Space Complexity - Append is O(n) - dependent on size of linked_list
#Time Complexity - to_list is O(n) time
#Space Complexity is O(1) - to_list no incremental variable growth dependent on input
