#Problem 1
#Initial Cache and Linked List Structure - Credit to Udacity
#Linked List data structure append: O(1) time
#Time Complexity - Cache get uses dictionary data structure to allow access in O(1) time
#Time Complexity - Cache set uses dictionary structure to allow access in O(1) time
#Space Complexity is O(n) - dictionary size grows in proportion to input
