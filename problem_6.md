#Problem 6
#Credit to Udacity for Node and LinkedList data structures
#Creates combined list from all values in input lists to create union
#Creates intersection list from all values in both input lists to create intersection
#Time Complexity- union loops through values of both lists - O(n^2)
#Space Complexity - union at worst holds all values from both lists - O(n)
#Time Complexity - intersection loops through values of both lists - O(n^2)
#Space complexity intersection is O(n) - list grows to greatest maximum if all of one list'
